*Welcome to _db2unit_ and thanks for contributing to this project.*

## Bugs

If you found a bug and you are creating an issue, please describe as much as
possible the environment where you execute this framework:

 * Platform (OS, version, architecture (32/64 bits))
 * DB2 (edition, version, fixpack)
 * Dependency (log4db2 version)
 * Utility (version)

And explain us what you did, what you git, and what you did not get.

Do not worry about labels or milestones, once we will see your issue, we will
assign the corresponding values.

## Develop

If you develop a new feature (bug fix, enhancement, etc.) and you want that
feature be integrated in the project, please make sure you wrote some tests,
in order to help us verify that this feature does not get into conflict with
the existing. Remember that this project has been developed as TDD.

This project follows a code convention. Please try to follow it in order to
have a standard code across all contributions:
