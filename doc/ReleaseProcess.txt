This is the procedure to do for each release.

There are three sections:

* BEFORE: To prepare the release.
* PERFORM: Tasks that conform the release.
* AFTER: Once the release has been done, some extra tasks to prepare the env.

BEFORE

* Run all tests to make sure there are not regressions.
* To change the version constant in the code (Headers.sql:VERSION):
https://github.com/angoca/db2unit/blob/master/src/main/sql-pl/Headers.sql
* Change the version in the documentation (@version) of all source files.
* Make sure the schema reflects the version number to release (all files.)
* Perform last commit and push.

PERFORM

* Execute mvn release:prepare providing a valid TAG (1-Beta, 1) and a SNAPSHOT
  for the next release
* Once finished, execute mvn release:perform.
  (If problems, mvn release:rollback)
* Fill the code release in GitHub (https://github.com/angoca/db2unit/releases)
* Execute mvn.
* Fill the ChangeLog page in the wiki with all changes. To review the changes
  compare the tag (git diff previous-tag current-tag)

AFTER

* To change the schema name to the new version in all files.
* Check that there are not references to the previous release.
* Commit these changes and publish.
