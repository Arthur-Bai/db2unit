There are three sections:

* BEFORE: To prepare the release.
* PERFORM: Tasks that conform the release.
* AFTER: Once the release has been done, some extra tasks to prepare the env.

BEFORE

* Run all tests to make sure there are not regressions.
* To change the version constant in the code (Headers.sql:VERSION):
https://github.com/angoca/db2unit/blob/master/src/main/sql-pl/Headers.sql
* Write the changes in the ChangeLog section of the wiki.
* Update the Prerequisites table from the Install section of the wiki.
* Change the version in the documentation (@version) of all source files.
* Make sure the schema reflects the version number to release (all files.)

* Execute mvn release:prepare providing a valid TAG (1-Beta, 1) and a SNAPSHOT

* Once finished, execute mvn release:perform.
  (If problems, mvn release:rollback)
* Fill the code release in GitHub (https://github.com/angoca/db2unit/releases)
* Execute mvn.
